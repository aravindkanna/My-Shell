# My-Shell
This is a model for Linux terminal implemented in C++ programming language using concepts of fork, exec, signals, pipes etc. Different kind of interrupts were also handled. <br>

##How to run?
Yeah, it is basically a simple C++ code and you have to run just as you run a .cpp extended file. For the compilation you should have g++ installed in your system. When the code is being executed you just treat it like the shell and give it commands(valid though).<br>

Compiling : `g++ my_shell.cpp`<br>
Execution : `./a.out` <br>

The main target is to play with system calls. :smile:

##Install g++ in your system

1) `sudo apt-get update`<br>
2) `sudo apt-get install g++`
